Develop	an	Android	 Mobile application,	which	allows	users	to	search	for	stock	information,	save	some	stock	symbols	
as favorites,	and	post	to	the	Facebook	timeline.	You	should	reuse	the	backend	service	
(PHP/node.js script).
Once	the	user	has	entered	some	characters in	the	edit	box	and	selected	a	matching	result	from
the	autocomplete	list,	he/she	would	click	on	Get Quote,	at	which	point	validation	must	be	done
to	check	that	the	entered	data	is	not	empty.
Once	the	validation	is	successful,	we	would	get	the	profile	details	using	our	PHP	script	hosted	on	
Amazon	Web	Services/Google	App	Engine,	which	would	return	the	result	in	JSON	format.	We	
would	display	the	stock	details	in	a	ListView	component	in	the	‘Current’	tab.		Furthermore,	our	
PHP script would	be	responsible	for	rendering	the	HighCharts	in	the	‘Current’	and	‘Historical’	
tabs and	also	rending	the	news	articles	in	the	‘News’	tab.
